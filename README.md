# Jets Project
Jets project aims to show all the jets' info, longest jets, fastest jets and the hours a jet can run until no gas.
# Description
This program, i mainly used few same ways to read the txt files, though I am still confused about the Bufferreader, but i tried my best to use this reader in each method to get the jets information, so that we can find out which jet has the longest range, which has the fastest speed, and how to get the hour they can fly. I know there must be ways to make the code looks clean and simple, however, i totally lost in my code, i can not figure out how to make it easier.

# Technologies Used
I used the list, method, switch, if else , while loop.
I am still not really clear regarding the list ,but i believe that after more practice, i will understand it better.

# What I learned
sometimes, you need a break, and your mind will clear than before. And once, you can not have a better way right now, maybe some duplicate, repeated method can work, just let the code runs first and try to simplifier it later.
